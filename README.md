# Triaxial Accelerometer Tracking

This project interfaces a ten degree-of-freedom (10-DOF) breakout board's accelerometer (LSM303) with the Beagle Bone microcomputer by taking advantage of the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication protocol. Once the data from the sensors is acquired locally on the microcomputer it parses and manipulate the raw data into a usable form. This allows the user to implement this system on various platforms to track motion data and determine trajectories in real time from robots working on a two-dimensional (2D) plane to rockets flying on complex three-dimensional (3D) paths.

This project was completed as a requirement for ECE 103, Digital Systems, to earn an undergraduate degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering.
